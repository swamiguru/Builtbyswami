  // Browsers auto-redirect a vertical wheel/trackpad gesture into horizontal
  // scrolling when it's over an element that only overflows on the x-axis —
  // convenient for shift-less horizontal scrolling, but it also swallows the
  // page's vertical scroll while the cursor happens to be over the rail, so
  // the whole page appears stuck. Detect a vertical-dominant gesture and
  // forward it to the page instead of letting the track eat it. Must be a
  // native (non-passive) listener since React's onWheel is passive by
  // default and can't call preventDefault.
  //
  // Deciding per-tick (comparing deltaX/deltaY on every event) is what made
  // this feel "stuck": a single trackpad swipe rarely moves on one axis
  // only, so consecutive ticks within the same gesture can flip between
  // "forward to page" and "let the rail eat it," pausing the page scroll
  // mid-gesture. Instead, lock the axis on the first tick of a gesture and
  // hold that decision until the gesture goes idle for a beat.
  //
  // A few more things were making the forwarded scroll feel heavy, slow, or
  // janky compared to scrolling anywhere else on the page:
  // 1. A trackpad's momentum ("fling") phase keeps sending wheel ticks with
  //    growing gaps between them as it decelerates. A 150ms idle window was
  //    tight enough to land inside one of those gaps, resetting the axis
  //    lock mid-flick and cutting the scroll short — you'd have to scroll
  //    again to cover the same distance a normal flick would. 250ms rides
  //    out that tail.
  // 2. Not every device reports deltaY in pixels — Firefox (and some mice)
  //    use "lines" or "pages." Forwarding that raw number straight into
  //    scrollBy scrolled a tiny fraction of what the browser's own handling
  //    would have covered. Normalize to pixels first.
  // 3. Calling window.scrollBy synchronously on every single wheel tick
  //    forces a layout on the main thread once per tick. Trackpads can fire
  //    ticks faster than the display refreshes, so several scrollBy calls
  //    were competing within one frame budget — this is what read as janky
  //    on Chrome. Accumulate the pending distance and flush it once per
  //    animation frame instead.
  // 4. THE BIG ONE, confirmed by testing live in the console: `html` has
  //    `scroll-behavior: smooth` globally (index.css). scrollBy/scrollTo
  //    without an explicit `behavior` defer to that CSS value — so every
  //    one of our rAF-batched calls was silently starting a ~300ms smooth
  //    animation and immediately restarting it on the next frame before it
  //    could get anywhere. Verified: 30 calls of scrollBy({top:20}) at one
  //    per frame moved the page 58px total instead of the expected 600px.
  //    Passing behavior: "instant" bypasses the CSS default and actually
  //    moves the full distance we already computed.

          element with overflow-x set to anything but visible computes its
          unset overflow-y as auto too. Confirmed live that this track's
          padding gave it ~16px of genuine vertical overflow, so without
          this it was a real (if tiny) vertical scroll container in its own
          right — competing with our own axis detection above.

          Deliberately NOT setting touch-action: pan-x here (an earlier,
          unverified attempt at this did). touch-action is locked in at
          touchstart, before the browser knows which way the finger is
          about to move, so it can't be corrected mid-gesture the way the
          wheel handler above corrects per-tick — there's no JS fix
          available here. Pinning it to pan-x forced every touch that
          starts on a card to be treated as horizontal, which silently ate
          vertical page scroll on real devices (confirmed on both mobile
          Chrome and mobile Safari — a browser-default problem, not a
          per-engine bug). Leaving touch-action at its default "auto" lets
          each browser's own, generally reliable, first-move heuristic
          decide the axis per gesture instead. */}
